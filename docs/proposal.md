## 2. Background

### What is it about?
The success of athletes from different nations might be tracked, trends in athletes' ages, heights, and weight could be examined over time, and it could be determined which sports and events had a higher chance of producing medals.

### Why does it matter?
The dataset is significant because it offers useful data for sports analysis, worldwide and national comparisons, historical research, and decision-making about the growth and development of sports. Additionally, it advances our knowledge of the Olympic Games and its relevance in the sports world.

### What are your research questions?
The outcome from research on the Olympic dataset may undoubtedly help us better comprehend the larger sociological and cultural shifts that have affected the world of sports throughout time, in addition to influencing sports policy and practice. They can also provide helpful information for organizing events, allocating resources, and encouraging people to participate in sports and physical exercise at the local, state, and federal levels.
